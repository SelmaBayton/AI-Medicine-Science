The Microdot library is a web framework that allows you to build web applications in Python.
Microdot is a lightweight web framework for Python that allows you to easily create web applications or APIs. It provides a minimalistic and simple approach to building web services. It is similar in concept to other micro-frameworks like Flask or Bottle.


When using Microdot, you typically write your application code in Python files with a `.py` extension, similar to other Python programs. These files contain the code to define routes, handle requests, and generate responses for your web application.
